## Abstract

Relational databases can be detrimental to a systems functions, when not handling relational database data structures and queries correctly. 
These issues also extend to things like select queries, insert queries, joining multiple tables and more.
This problem is especially harmfull when the dataset grows larger, and gets exponentially worse with size.

This problem is a tremendous problem, because it will cause age long search sessions and generally results in a waste of time and ressources for the system.
In addition, the database can stagger and fall behind in real time proccessing and may result in data loss, data corruption or even system failure / database crash.
By not thinking of this problem, it will cause great decrease in user satisfaction, because the user might need to wait very long for a response from the system.
Decreased user satisfaction will lead to lower monetary gain because users will leave / stop using the service, by going to other services.
Other than these, it will also cost alot more money to keep ineffective solutions running.

The issue stems from inproper implementation of search algorithms, data structure and can be easily avoided with a few simple tricks.
Relation databases are designed with relations in mind. This means, everything is indexed and therefor following a simple guideline to find relevant data in the database.
Here is a few simple tricks to handle relational data structures and queries correctly, so the database can effective do it's job.
Foreignkeys are important to implement, if the system needs to get data based on other sets of data. It is easy to implement in the beginning, but hard to change after launch.
Avoid redudant data fields in tables when dealing interconnected datasets.
Prepare queries before executing, this will ensure that no SQL injection are possible.
Joining tables, Big table left join small table. Be mindfull of the size of each table, try to have the join as small as possible.

This will standardise database search speeds with ever growing datasets and will make alot of users happy. 
It will also, increase the buttom line / monetery gain by a lot. It will also safeguard you from ever degrading performance.
It will make the system alot safer by not allowing SQL Injections by hackers and it will also make the database size smaller and more managable.


## UFO blog introduction
In the current days digital age, our data usage has been growing at a rate that would put the singularity to shame. the demand for ways to store and access this ever growing demand has crippled programmers around the world, especially with the new trend of writing down every little detail of every person that traverse the internet, inorder for the big corperations sale targets.
